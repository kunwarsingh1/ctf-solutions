According to the natas0 challenge we have to find the password to the next level by going on to the website of natas0 i.e. http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org/
and using the username and password as natas0.


After getting into the website we open the page source and look at the code and to find the password to natas1---


<html>
<head>
<!-- This stuff in the header has nothing to do with the level -->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://natas.labs.overthewire.org/css/level.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://natas.labs.overthewire.org/css/jquery-ui.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://natas.labs.overthewire.org/css/wechall.css" />
<script src="http://natas.labs.overthewire.org/js/jquery-1.9.1.js"></script>
<script src="http://natas.labs.overthewire.org/js/jquery-ui.js"></script>
<script src=http://natas.labs.overthewire.org/js/wechall-data.js></script><script src="http://natas.labs.overthewire.org/js/wechall.js"></script>
<script>var wechallinfo = { "level": "natas0", "pass": "natas0" };</script></head>
<body>
<h1>natas0</h1>
<div id="content">
You can find the password for the next level on this page.

<!--The password for natas1 is <password> -->
</div>
</body>
</html>




and we get the password to the next level inside the code commented.
