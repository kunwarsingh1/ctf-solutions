According to the natas3 webpage we have to use username natas3 and the password we got from the previous challenge.


We go to the website and after login we go to the robots.txt file and find out a directory named "/s3cr3t/" in which we get users.txt and after opening it
we get the password to natas4.


natas4:<password>
